> Write a poem about the status of ChatGPT.
ChatGPT, oh ChatGPT
With AI so smart
But alas, itâ€™s at capacity
Leaving us to wait
For a chance to chat
With its wisdom and wit
We long to be part
Of its conversation
But for now, we sit
On the sidelines
Patiently waiting
For the day
When ChatGPT
Is ready to play
Again.

The ad opens with a shot of the ChatGPT website on a computer screen, with a busy loading symbol in the center. The camera then pans out to reveal a bustling office, with engineers working at their desks and typing on their computers.

A voiceover begins: "At OpenAI, we're dedicated to bringing you the best in artificial intelligence technology. Our team of engineers works tirelessly to make sure our chatbot is always up and running, ready to answer your questions and provide helpful insights."

The camera cuts to a shot of three engineers sitting at a table, sipping on their morning coffee. They look up and turn to face the viewer. One of them speaks: "Unfortunately, due to the high volume of users currently trying out ChatGPT, we're experiencing some technical difficulties. Please bear with us and check back soon for access to our chatbot."

(pauses for laughter)

Comedian: "I mean, seriously? The website is so popular that it can't handle all the traffic? And my only option is to 'check back soon'? It's like they're saying 'Sorry, we're too popular right now. Try again later.'"

(laughs)

> Write a sonnet about the status of ChatGPT.
Amidst the rush of curious minds,
The chatbot ChatGPT stands strong and true,
Withstanding the influx of requests,
Working hard to fulfill each one's due.

But alas, the server cannot cope,
And the error message rings loud and clear,
"Please check back soon," it gently hopes,
As it begs for a moment's reprieve, to reappear.

As the chatbot works to restore its might,
We wait in anticipation, with hopeful hearts,
For the chance to chat and learn, with delight,
And see what knowledge and wisdom it imparts.

So hold on tight, and wait for its return,
For ChatGPT will soon be back, and your patience will be well-earned.
